# Home Manager — project context for Claude Code

This file is read automatically at the start of every Claude Code session in
this repo. It's a status briefing, not the full history — for engineering
decisions and root-caused bugs, see **Decision log** below; append to it as
you go, in the same terse style (fact, then why). The `design_handoff_home_manager/`
and `design_handoff_shell/` directories are UI/design-system handoff docs from
two separate redesign efforts (screens, tokens, copy, interaction specs) —
useful for "why does this screen look like this," but they are **not** an
engineering decision log, despite an earlier version of this file claiming
otherwise.

## What this is

A household assistant app: FastAPI + SQLite backend (`app/`), vanilla
HTML/CSS/JS frontend (`static/`), no build step, no framework. An
Anthropic-Claude chat agent (`app/agent.py`, tool-calling against
`app/tools.py`) plans meals, manages a grocery list, tracks kitchen
inventory, and answers "what we know" about the household. Deployed to
Railway, auto-deploying from `main` on push. Live at
`home-manager-production-4949.up.railway.app`.

## Current state (as of 2026-08-30)

`main` is live on Railway with no other active branches. Recent work has been
incremental bug fixes and chat-agent reliability improvements — see Decision
log below for specifics. If you're picking this repo up fresh, run
`git log --oneline -15` to confirm this is still accurate.

## Working style established so far

- **Sandbox-verify everything before calling it done.** Fresh/reset SQLite
  DB, real `uvicorn` process, Playwright with `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`
  for anything UI-facing. Don't trust a fix until it's actually been run.
  For chat-agent behavior specifically, a real API call reproduction (stub
  `TOOL_FUNCTIONS` to bypass DB state if needed) beats reasoning from code
  alone — see the max_tokens entry in the Decision log for an example.
- **Keep the Decision log below updated** — every scope deviation, bug
  root-caused, and judgment call, honestly including things that were tried
  and didn't work. This is what makes the project legible to the next
  session (human or Claude), replacing the broken pointer this file used to
  have.
- A recurring local sandbox quirk (may or may not reproduce in your
  environment): `pkill -f uvicorn` and combined multi-step heredoc bash
  commands intermittently return exit 144 while silently not completing.
  Split DB-reset steps into separate, individually-verified commands rather
  than chaining them.

## Known architectural gotchas (don't re-discover these the hard way)

- **A single chat turn's `max_tokens` cap can be outrun by open-ended
  multi-tool work.** A request that touches many meal slots/recipes in one
  turn (e.g. rebuild a week's dinners with new recipes) can need more output
  than any fixed cap — reproduced needing 8+ unresolved tool_use blocks at
  16000 output tokens. `run_agent_turn` (agent.py) now retries the round
  instead of returning a dead-end apology when `stop_reason == "max_tokens"`,
  bounded by `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS`. If you add another single-shot LLM call
  elsewhere in this file (there are several, each with their own
  `max_tokens`), consider whether it needs the same retry-on-truncation
  treatment rather than just a bigger fixed number.
- **Tab panels build once per page load.** `static/shell.js`'s
  `buildWeekPanel`/`buildTodayPanel`/etc. are guarded by
  `panel.dataset.built`, so switching tabs away and back does NOT refetch
  data. Any change made via chat (or otherwise) to an already-built panel's
  data goes stale until reload, unless something explicitly refreshes it —
  see `refreshStaleTabsFromActions()` in shell.js, which now does this for
  chat-driven changes by reading each turn's `actions[].tab` field.
- **"Current week" plan resolution** is centralized in
  `tools._current_weekly_plan_row()` — it prefers the plan whose week
  actually contains today, falling back to most-recently-created only if
  none does. This used to be "just pick whichever plan has the latest
  `created_at`" everywhere, which silently drifted from "this week" the
  moment any other plan existed (a leftover old plan, a pre-planned future
  week). If you add a new "give me the current plan" call site, use this
  helper — don't re-derive the old raw query.
- **`generate_weekly_plan` (agent.py) generates before it persists.** It
  used to create the `weekly_plans` row first and fill it in after, which
  meant a failed/truncated LLM call left a permanently empty "current week"
  plan with no error shown anywhere. Now it only writes anything once it
  has real content, and raises a clear error otherwise (which the chat
  loop's existing per-tool `try/except` surfaces back to the model as a
  normal tool error).
- **Grocery quantity merging/display** goes through
  `_humanize_grocery_quantity()` (tools.py) — discrete items round up to a
  whole number (can't buy 1.5 onions), measurable units (tsp/tbsp/cup,
  oz/lb, g/kg, ml/l) roll up to the largest sensible unit. `scale_recipe`'s
  own scaling is intentionally NOT run through this — that's for cooking,
  not shopping, and wants precise amounts in the recipe's original unit.
  Multi-word container units ("1 lb bag") and prep-descriptor-bearing
  ingredient names ("Baby spinach, chopped") have both bitten this before —
  see Decision log.
- Service worker (`static/service-worker.js`) is network-first for
  navigations/`.html`/`.js`/`.css`, cache-first only for icons/manifest —
  this was a real stale-cache bug once (`CACHE_NAME` bumped to `v3` to
  force-clear it). If a fix "isn't showing up" on a real device, suspect
  this before suspecting the code — especially on an installed iOS
  Home-Screen PWA, which is slower to pick up service worker updates than a
  normal browser tab.
- **`home_manager` logger's INFO output was silently dropped** until
  `main.py` added `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, ...)`. Nothing
  else in the app configures logging, and Python's default "handler of last
  resort" only surfaces WARNING and above — so any new `logger.info(...)`
  call anywhere in this app will actually show up now, but double-check
  this basicConfig call is still there if logging output ever goes quiet
  again.

## Decision log (root-caused bugs, judgment calls — append here as you go)

Newest first. Keep entries terse: one line of fact, one line of why. Full
detail lives in the commit that made the change (`git log --oneline` /
`git show <hash>`) — this log is for surfacing *that something happened and
why*, not duplicating the diff.

- **2026-08-30 — Proactive checks (`get_attention_items`, `get_expiring_soon`)
  moved from a system-prompt instruction to code.** They previously relied on
  the model remembering to call them "near the start of a conversation," a
  soft instruction easy to let slide. `run_agent_turn` now takes a
  `proactive_check` flag; `main.py` sets it when a session's last message was
  4+ hours ago, and `agent._build_proactive_check_block()` runs both checks
  and injects anything genuinely pending as a system block before the model
  ever sees the turn. Verified live: a seeded expiring item got worked into
  the reply unprompted. Not yet pushed to origin/main as of this entry —
  check `git log origin/main..HEAD` before assuming it's deployed.
- **2026-08-30 — "Start over" (self-service reset) added to the Meals tab.**
  Wiping a week's plan or the grocery list previously meant chat, or
  `reset_household.py` — an admin script that wipes *everything*
  (recipes, chores, members) and is not meant for regular use. New
  `tools.clear_weekly_plan()` loops the existing per-meal
  `_reverse_meal_grocery_contributions()` over the plan's entries rather
  than reinventing the grocery-side logic, and empties the `weekly_plans`
  row instead of deleting it so the week's dates/constraints survive and
  `_current_weekly_plan_row` isn't left choosing between an orphan and a
  new plan. Two judgment calls worth knowing: the entry point is a row in
  `.week-content` (a sibling of `#week-mobile`/`#week-grid`), because
  `#week-header` is desktop-only and would have hidden the button on the
  phone PWA; and with both resets selected the plan runs first, so the
  toast names "the grocery list" rather than a count — the count would
  read "1 grocery item" for a list that just went from 9 to 0, since the
  plan's own reversal already took the other 8.

- **2026-08-30 — Grocery list over-counted staples and fragmented
  near-duplicate ingredient names.** Every recipe using a small-use staple
  (garlic powder, olive oil) independently added a full store-bought unit
  (10 recipes → 10 jars); prep-descriptor differences ("chopped" vs not)
  blocked exact-name merging. Fixed by only writing a real quantity on a
  staple's first use per week, and stripping prep descriptors before
  merging names.
- **2026-08-30 — Chat turn could dead-end on `stop_reason == "max_tokens"`.**
  See the Known architectural gotchas entry above — root cause and fix are
  the same thing.
- **2026-08-30 — Prompt caching was not enabled on the main chat loop.**
  System prompt (~7.6K tokens) + tool defs (~15K tokens) were resent
  uncached every single turn. Split the system prompt into a frozen,
  cache-marked block plus a small uncached "today's date" block (kept
  separate so the date changing daily doesn't bust the cache), and added
  top-level automatic caching so the growing conversation history is also
  read from cache turn-over-turn. Verified with live `cache_read`/
  `cache_creation` numbers, not just by reading the code — see the
  `home_manager` logger fix above for why that verification wasn't visible
  before.
- **2026-08-30 — Voice dictation was chat-only; Stores tab had no way to add
  a store directly.** Extracted dictation into a shared
  `static/dictation.js` (Grocery/Inventory/Memory are separate iframed
  documents that can't reach `shell.js`'s copy). Added a "+ Add a store"
  control — the Stores tab is the documented onboarding replacement for
  "where do you shop" but previously had no add path of its own.
- **2026-08-29 — "This week" planning could target the wrong week late in
  the week.** Asked on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday, the chat agent would
  generate a plan starting *next* Monday instead of filling the current
  week — a real, saved plan the Meals tab then never shows, since it only
  displays the plan whose week actually contains today. Same failure class
  as an earlier "chat describes a plan the tab doesn't show" bug, just
  reached via the agent choosing the wrong week to generate for in the
  first place.

## Deploying

Push to `main` on GitHub; Railway auto-deploys from there. CI runs the smoke
test suite on every push (added in the `hardening` work).

**Required Railway variables — confirmed set as of the `hardening` merge, but
worth re-checking if the live site ever misbehaves:**

- `HOME_MANAGER_PASSWORD` and `SESSION_SECRET` — required, or the app fails
  closed to all remote traffic by design.
- `DB_PATH=/data/home_manager.db` **with an actual volume mounted at `/data`.**
  If `DB_PATH` isn't set (or the volume isn't mounted), every redeploy
  silently wipes the household's database. This is a real data-loss risk,
  not a theoretical one.
- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` — used for share links.
- A **spend cap on the Anthropic API key** in the console — worth
  double-checking this is actually in place, since it can't be verified from
  the repo. Rate limiting (`app/ratelimit.py`) caps the request rate, not
  total spend — they're not the same protection.

## A full code review already exists — read it before doing more hardening work

A 17-finding review of the whole codebase was done alongside the `hardening`
work (findings ranked, with which are fixed and which aren't):
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/0d42e9f3-4e71-401d-a4c0-1a1f1983dbf2

Findings 1/2/3/5/6/7/12/13/17 are fixed and now live on `main`.
**Still open, in case you're deciding what to work on next:**

- **#8** — `app/tools.py` is 5,143+ lines with 188+ `HOUSEHOLD_ID` references.
  Split it into a package by domain *before* doing real auth/multi-tenancy
  work — the smoke test suite (running in CI on every push) makes this
  safe to do now.
- **#9** — the shell's tabs are iframes; navigation workarounds (see the
  Kitchen back-link bug fixed earlier) are accumulating as a result.
- **#10** — no shared `api.js`; ~26 hand-written `fetch('/api/...')` call
  sites, and pages carry 30–60 KB of inline CSS/JS each that can't be
  cached separately from the page.
- **#11** — three overlapping color vocabularies in `theme.css`.
- **#14** — "What we know" effectively asks the household to do data entry;
  autosave and collapse would help.
- **#15** — loading states are bare "Loading…" against a design system that
  otherwise commits to warm, first-person copy.
- **#16** — two navigation systems (client-side tabs vs. full page loads)
  that look identical but behave differently.

That review's own notes also flag: it verified the backend against a real
uvicorn server, but never actually saw the frontend rendered — broad
visual/screen-reader verification of the whole app is still an open gap.

## Immediate open items

1. **Recommendation enforcement** — `get_attention_items`/`get_expiring_soon`
   now code-enforced at session start (see Decision log). Not yet pushed to
   `origin/main`. Still prompt-only, and candidates for the same treatment
   if it proves valuable: `get_cross_location_duplicates`, the feedback
   nudge's own re-surfacing cadence.
2. Consider tackling code-review finding #8 (splitting `tools.py`) next,
   now that it's safely testable — before layering more auth/multi-tenancy
   work on top of the current single-file size.
3. The still-open findings (#9–#11, #14–#16 above) are real but not urgent —
   good candidates for "what should we work on next" rather than anything
   blocking.
